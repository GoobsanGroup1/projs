## About The Project

I created many projects about front End this README  available on GitHub ; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.
Here's why:

1. Your time should be focused on creating something
amazing.
2. A project that solves a problem and helps others
You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a projects from scratch
3. You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repositories and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

## Built With

* html and css
* bootstrap
* javaScript
* JQuery
